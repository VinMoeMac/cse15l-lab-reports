- In this second command I use `grep` and the options `-i` (non case sensitive) and `-r` (search recursively through a directory and subdirectories) to find every line containing "alone " without case sensitivity in the txt files from the 911report directory and print them alongside the name of the file it is from.

```
- This third command is similar in how it searches recursively through the 911report directory for "big ", but this time it is case sensitive (because of the absence of `-i`) and it only prints the file names of files that contain "big " (-l denotes that the search returns files with matches)

- In this case the `-wr` is specifying that the the search be both recursive over the directory (plos/) and that there must be a matching word in a line rather than just a search for lines with the string within it. Like the first two commands it returns the applicable lines (with the word "super") and the file name.

```

```
- For this command `-v` is specifying that the search it is looking for a simple non case sensitive match for "a" in the lines of rr166.txt. This is a different command compared to the first two because it is not searching recursively through a whole directory, but just one file, and it prints the lines _without_ the match.

```
[cs15lsp23km@ieng6-201]:biomed:124$ grep -v " " rr166.txt

```
- This is another use of `-v` to search the same file for lines absent of " ". Because there is only one line without a space it prints that one line.
